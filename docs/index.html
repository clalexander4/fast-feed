<h1>FastFeed</h1>
<h2>Get more out of social media by using it less</h2>
<p>FastFeed combines multiple social media connections into one app, letting you see what's important to you in a single feed. You can create new feeds based on interests, and quickly swap between them. FastFeed lets you know when you've reached the end of your feed, so you don't end up reading the same posts over and over.
<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Curate your social media feed to stop endless scrolling</li>
    <li>Follow topics you care about easily</li>
    <li>Shut down negativity in the press of a button</li>
    <li>Restrict how much data social media platforms can collect</li>
</ul>
